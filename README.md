# ðŸŽ¯ Number Guessing Game

A simple number guessing game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The game picks a random number between 1 and 10. The user tries to guess it and gets instant feedback.  
Styled with custom CSS to make it look clean and fun.

> Inspired by a Tutedude JS module â€” customized with my own styling and improvements.
